-> Self contained units of code which carry out a certain Job
-> Help us divide a program into small manageable repeatable and organisable chunks

why use function?
-> reusability
-> abstraction

function syntax :-
                    func <function_name>(<params>)return_type>{
                    // block of code
                    }
