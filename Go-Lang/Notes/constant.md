syntax:
    const <constname> <datatype> = <value>

there are two type of constant.
1. untyped conatant
   -> constant are untyped unleas they are explicity given a type at declaration
   -> allow for flexibility

   exp:-  const age = 23

   const h-name,h-age = "hera", 23


   2. typed constant
      -> constant are typed when you explicitly specify the type in the declaration
      -> flexibility that comes with untyped constant is lost.
      
      examples=>
       constant name string="jibachh"
      const age int = 23
