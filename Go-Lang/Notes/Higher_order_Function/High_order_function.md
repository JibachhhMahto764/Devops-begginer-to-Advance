High_order_functions.......
  -> functions that receives a function as an argument or returns a function as output.

  why use high order function in go?
   -> composition. -> creating smaller functions that take care of certain piece of logic
   -> composing complex function by using different smaller function
   -> reduce bugs
    ->  code gets easier to read and understand
