Bitwise operators allow manipulation of individual bits of data. They perform bit-level operations on operands. The bitwise operators in Go include:

AND (&): Performs a bitwise AND.
OR (|): Performs a bitwise OR.
XOR (^): Performs a bitwise XOR.
AND NOT (&^): Clears the bits (in the first operand) that are set in the second operand.
Left shift (<<): Shifts the bits of the first operand to the left by the number of positions specified by the second operand.
Right shift (>>): Shifts the bits of the first operand to the right by the number of positions specified by the second operand.
