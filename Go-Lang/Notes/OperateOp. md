In Go, logical operators are used to perform logical operations on boolean values. The logical operators available in Go are:
&& (logical AND): Returns true if both operands are true.
 
|| (logical OR): Returns true if at      least one of the operands is true.
   
! (logical NOT): Returns true if the operand is false, and vice versa.
