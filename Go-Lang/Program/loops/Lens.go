Lens()  ->  The length of the array refers to the numbers of elements stored in the array.

example:-
           package main
           import("fmt")

           func main(){
             var fruits[2] string = [2] string {"Ram","Hari"}
             fmt.PrintIn(lens(fruits))
             }

Index is always lies between 0 to length -1
   0 <= index <= lens-1
